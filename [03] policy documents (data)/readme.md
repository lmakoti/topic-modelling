### Data Collection (Public Policy Documents)

A representative set of public policy documents would cover a range of topics, including economic policy, environmental policy, health care, education, national security, social welfare, urban planning, transportation, labour, and international relations. Here's a list that includes a variety of document types, such as laws, policy proposals, strategic plans, and reports, to provide a broad perspective on public policy.

To compile a list of public policy documents from a random set of 10 Commonwealth countries from different regions of the world, I will select countries first and then identify an example of a public policy document for each, focusing on a diverse range of policy areas. However, please note that direct links to these documents may vary over time due to updates on governmental or organizational websites. I will also provide a general description of where these documents can typically be found.
